      <p>Well, Byggstad is approved but it wased yet even been planned :(. So we need you help to plan this nice place. </p>
<p>Choose any cell in a grid to build there something. Once cell is selected you can see number of options that can be build. Once you decided what you want to see at this cell press "CHOOSE" behind the picture. Don't worry about the money - just try to build a nice big town. Remember that people want to have homes, work and places to have fun. Of course all have to be connected with a road network. Ah, and some resourses are limited (you can have max 9 houses districts, 5 job sectors atc as written near each type).</br>
Once you are done, just press "Finish"</p>
